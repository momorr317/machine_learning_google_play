While many public datasets online provide Apple App Store data, there are not many counterpart datasets available for Google Play Store Apps anywhere on the web. The Play Store Apps data has enormous potential to drive App-making businesses to success. Actionable insights can be drawn for developers to work on and capture the Android market. So this dataset we used is scraped from the Google Play Store, which contains 10,000 entries of data of Play Store Apps for analyzing the Android market and each App has 13 features to describe them, such as category, reviews, rating etc. We will do Exploratory Data Analysis, supplemented by some empirically competent statistical models to see which features will affect the rating of Apps and build models to predict the rating for Google Play Store Apps.
